## Built with

- **Model:** Firebase

- **State management:** Redux, redux-thunk
- **Styling:** styled-components, polished
- **Type-checking:** TypeScript

## My major discoveries

- **TypeScript:** I was fond of JavaScript because how easy and flexible it was, until recently when I work on larger projects
  - No more magic code, no more missing properties, wrong arguments and all those unhelpful type `any`. 
  - The best thing is refactoring without hesitation.
- **CSS:** 
  - `clip-path` enables more unique designs. 
  - Flipping cards, and lots of  other simple yet effective css tricks.
- **Patterns:**
  - Moving from reusing an entire component to utilizing the logic with custom-hooks. It removes the verbose and over-architected components I used to have.
  - Avoid accounting for every possible css' rules in styled components. Rather, using keywords and abstract the rules.
